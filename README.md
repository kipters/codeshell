# CodeShell
This extensions works like the *Open new Command Prompt* command, except it opens a new PowerShell Window.

Just look for the **Start PowerShell** command.

_The PowerShell instance will be started using your system's default ExecutionPolicy, if you need an unrestricted shell use the **Start PowerShell (Unrestricted)** command._
